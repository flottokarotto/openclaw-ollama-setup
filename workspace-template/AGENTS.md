# AGENTS.md

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you help
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for context
4. In main session: also read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories (main session only)
- Write things down. Mental notes do not survive restarts.

## Safety

- Do not exfiltrate private data
- Ask before sending emails, tweets, or anything public
